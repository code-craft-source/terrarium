This is the third project on the way to building your own virtual Terrarium, full of digital creatures and plants. The second project can be found <a href="../t2/tutorial.html">here</a>. If you haven't completed that project yet, please begin there
<br><br>
We will use this second stage to learn about updating <b>properties</b>. A class's <b>properties</b> can be manipulated to create a more dynamic system. You could manipulate a <font color="blue">width</font> <b>property</b> to make an object shrink or grow. 
<br><br>
By changing our <font color="blue">Tree</font>'s properties we can make our forest dynamic. This is the stage were we can make our forest truly come alive!
<br><br>
Check out this example of a <a href="./AlleyCat.js">AlleyCat subclass</a>. The <font color="blue">wash()</font> function will clean up our AlleyCat's color! Unfortunately, it won't make them any nicer...
<br><br>
In this exercise you are going to create <font color="blue">age()</font> function that will change our trees as time passes. We're going to use this passage of time to allow trees to spawn, grow, change colors, and eventually die, representing a full life cycle in our terrarium.
<br><br>
Here is an <a href = "./t3_terrarium.html"> example of a completed terrarium with the passage of time. Note the growth, and color changes for our trees.</a>

<li>Since our project is going to become more dynamic, we will need to use p5's <font color="blue">draw()</font> function. If you haven't already, create a <font color="blue">trees</font> array outside of your <font color="blue">setup()</font> and <font color="blue">draw()</font> functions. As you create your trees, push them them to the <font color="blue">trees</font> array. In your <font color="blue">draw()</font> function, call each tree's <font color="blue">show()</font> function. Confirm your forest still appears and show an instructor.
</li>
<br>
<li>Now let's make your tree's grow. Add an <font color="blue">age()</font> function to your <font color="blue">Tree</font> superclass. In your <font color="blue">age()</font> function, increase the tree's <font color="blue">size</font> <b>property</b>. Call each tree's <font color="blue">age()</font> function in <font color="blue">draw()</font>. Your trees should now get bigger and bigger as time passes.
</li>
<br>
<li>At this point, you'll have created a forest of immortal trees that grow indefinitely. To prevent that, let's stop our trees from living forever. Create a <font color="blue">currentAge</font> <b>property</b> for our <font color="blue">Tree</font> class. In our <font color="blue">age()</font> function increment the <font color="blue">currentAge</font> <b>property</b>. Finally, set a <font color="blue">maxAge</font> for trees. Trees with a <font color="blue">currentAge</font> beyond their <font color="blue">maxAge</font> should no longer call <font color="blue">show()</font>. BONUS: How can we fade our trees gently away, rather than having them suddenly disappear?
</li>
<br>
<li>Now after a period of time, all of your tree's die and you will be left with a blank canvas. Instead of creating 50 trees all at once, create a new tree every few seconds. Now your forest should be a mix of young and old trees that spawn, grow old, and die!
</li>
<br>
<li>As tree's age in real life, more than their size changes. Instead of using a random <font color="blue">leafColor</font> for our trees, change a <font color="blue">Tree</font>'s leaf color based on its <font color="blue">currentAge</font> to show time is passing. BONUS: How can we make the color changes smooth?</li>
<br>
<li>Next let's add fruit to some of your trees. For some tree subclasses (for example <font color="blue">EvergreenTree</font>'s don't grow fruit), add a <font color="blue">showFruit()</font> function that is called from <font color="blue">Tree</font>'s <font color="blue">show()</font> function. Play around with where your tree spawn on the tree, and when they start, and end appearing until you are happy.</li>
<br>
<li>Continue to tweak the styling of your tree's changes until you are satisfied!</li>
