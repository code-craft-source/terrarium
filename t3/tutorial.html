This is the third project on the way to building your own virtual Terrarium, full of digital creatures and plants. The second project can be found <a href="../t2/tutorial.html">here</a>. If you haven't completed that project yet, please begin there
<br><br>
We will use this second stage to learn about updating <b>properties</b>. A class's <b>properties</b> can be manipulated to create a more dynamic system. You could manipulate a <font color="blue">width</font> <b>property</b> to make an object shrink or grow. 
<br><br>
By changing our <font color="blue">Tree</font>'s properties we can make our forest dynamic and vibrate. This is the stage were we can make out forest truly come alive!
<br><br>
Check out this example of a <a href="./AlleyCat.js">AlleyCat subclass</a>. The <font color="blue">wash()</font> function will clean up our AlleyCat's color! Unfortunately, it won't make them any nicer...
<br><br>
In this exercise you are going to create <b>age()</b> function that will change our tree's as time passes. We're going to use this passage of time to allow trees to spawn, grow, change colors, and eventually die, representing a full life cycle in our terrarium.
<br><br>
Here is an <a href = "./t3_terrarium.html"> example of a completed terrarium with the passage of time. Note the growth, and color changes for our trees.</a>

<li>Since our project is going to become more dynamic, we will need to use p5's <b>draw()</b> function. If you haven't already, create a <b>trees</b> array outside of your <b>setup()</b> and <b>draw()</b> functions. As you create your trees, push them them to the <b>trees</b> array. In your <b>draw()</b> function, call each tree's <b>show()</b> function. Confirm your forest still appears and show an instructor.
</li>
<br>
<li>Now let's make your tree's grow. Add an <b>age()</b> function to your <b>Tree</b> superclass. In your <b>age()</b> function, increase the tree's <b>size</b> property. Call each tree's <b>age()</b> function in <b>draw()</b>. Your trees should now get bigger and bigger as time passes.
</li>
<br>
<li>At this point, you'll have created a forest of immortal trees that grow indefinitely. To prevent that, let's stop our trees from living forever. Create a <b>currentAge</b> <b>property</b> for our <b>Tree</b> class. In our <b>age()</b> function increment the <b>currentAge</b> property. Finally, set a <b>maxAge</b> for trees. Trees with a <b>currentAge</b> beyond their <b>maxAge</b> should no longer call <b>show()</b>. BONUS: How can we fade our trees gently away, rather than having them suddenly disappear?
</li>
<br>
<li>Now after a period of time, all of your tree's die and you will be left with a blank canvas. Instead of creating 50 trees all at once, create a new tree every few seconds. Now your forest should be a mix of young and old trees that spawn, grow old, and die.
</li>
<br>
<li>As tree's age in real life, more than their size changes. Instead of using a random <b>leafColor</b> for our trees, change a <b>Tree</b>'s leaf color based on its <b>currentAge</b> to show time is passing. BONUS: How can we make the color changes smooth?</li>
<br>
<li>Next let's add fruit to some of your trees. For some tree subclasses (for example <b>EvergreenTree</b>'s don't grow fruit), add a <b>showFruit()</b> function that is called from <b>Tree</b>'s <b>show()</b> function. Play around with where your tree spawn on the tree, and when they start, and end appearing until you are happy.</li>
<br>
<li>Continue to tweak the styling of your tree's changes until you are satisfied!</li>
