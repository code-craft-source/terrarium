This is the first project on the way to building your own virtual Terrarium, full of digital creatures and plants. 
<br><br>
We will use the Terrarium to learn about <b>Classes</b>. A class is a custom object that, in your code, can represent anything you want, like a game character, a creature or a bank account. The sprites in your games are built using classes like Rectangle, Text or Image. Arrays and Strings are classes too.
<br><br>

So whats so great about classes? 
<li>First, they have <b>properties</b> you can define, like <font color="blue">color</font> or <font color="blue">width</font> in your game sprites.
<li>Second, the have <b>methods</b> you can call to change them or get information about them. Like: <font color="blue">myBall.move()</font>
<li>Third, you can create many of them easily by calling <b>new</b>. Like: <font color="blue">myBall = new Circle() </font>.
The instructions for what should happen when you create this new <b>instance</b> of a class are stored in the class's 
<b>constructor.</b>
<br><br>
Check out this example of a <a href="./Cat.js">Cat class</a>.
<br><br>
In this exercise you are going to create a class called Tree, and then use that class to build a whole forest.
For now, our trees are going to be simple, just a trunk and a circle for leaves. In the following exercises, we are going to create more variety and have the forest come alive. 
<br><br>
Here is an <a href = "../projects/t1_terrarium.html"> example of a completed class forest</a>
<br><br>

	<li>Set up your HTML page, insert the p5.js source tags into the &lt;head&gt; section of your project page:
  <p class="tab"><font color="blue" face="courier"> 
 &lt;script src= "https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/0.6.0/p5.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br>

 &lt;script src= "http://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/0.5.6/addons/p5.dom.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</font>	</p>
Your code now speaks P5!
<br>
<br>
<li>In the <font color="blue">setup()</font> function, create a canvas and set your background color to something light.</li>
<br>
<li>Lets start by drawing a simple tree. First draw a trunk using p5's <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/line">line()</a> function. Place the tree in the screen's center.  Once you have your trunk, add leaves using the <a href="https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/ellipse">ellipse()</a> function. Give your trunk and leaves appropriate colors. Does your tree look good?</li>
<br>
<li>Now lets convert this simple tree into a Tree class. To start, your Tree will just have a method, called <font color="blue">show()</font> that will hold the code you just wrote to draw the tree.  <font color="blue">class</font> is the keyword to declare a Class, the same way you use <font color="blue">var</font>  to declare a variable!
<br>
<p class="code"> 
class Tree {
  show() {
    // Put your code for drawing the trunk and leaves here
  }
}
</p>
</li>
<br>
<li>With our Tree class in hand, we can create a new tree easily using the <font color="blue">new</font> keyword. Try creating a tree (call it myFirstTree) in the <font color="blue">setup()</font> section. Then call its <font color="blue">show()</font> method to put it on the screen. (HINT: look at the Cat class for an example.)</li>
<br>
<li>Now let's give our tree some additional <b>properties</b>. We can do that by adding a <font color="blue">constructor()</font> method to your Tree. A class's constructor is called everytime a new instance of the class, such as a new tree, is created. Lets start with <font color="blue">x</font> and <font color="blue">y</font> positions for the tree, a <font color="blue">leafColor</font>, and a <font color="blue">size</font>. 
<br><br>
Note that the x and y values are <b>passed as arguments</b> to your Tree class when you call <font color="blue">new</font> to create it. They are then converted to properties in the constructor. 

<p class="code">
class Tree {
  
  constructor(x, y) {
    // Use the syntax: this.property = YOUR CODE 
    // Look at the Cat example for help.
    // Convert the x and y arguments into properties here
    // Generate a leafColor property
    // Set the size property (this.size =)

  }

  show() {
    // Change your trunk and leaf code to use the new Tree properties
  }
}
</p>
Dont forget to update your <font color="blue">new Tree</font> call in the <font color="blue">setup()</font> section. 
</li>
<br>
<li>Now change this call to use random values for the <font color="blue">x</font> and <font color="blue">y</font>. Does your tree appear with a different color and in a different place every time you refresh the screen?
</li>
<br>
<li>Now lets turn your Tree class into a forest! In the <font color="blue">setup()</font> section, create 50 trees at random positions to generate your forest!</li>
<br>
<li>Continue to edit your code until it is readable, tidy, and you are satisfied. Have fun!!
</li>
